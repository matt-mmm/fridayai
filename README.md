# Friday AI Project by Matthew Manganillo & Ash Niemann

## System Information

Macbook Pro M1 Pro w/ Python 3.12.3

## Description

This is an experimental project created by Matthew Manganillo '25 and Ashley Niemann '26 of Lehigh University to create a "Friday" (think the recent Marvel movies!)-esque AI chatbot. The planed implementation will allow the chatbot to access large language models (in this case, GPT4-turbo), as well as access the internet to be able to solve both basic and complex queries.
